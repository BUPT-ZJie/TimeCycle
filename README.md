# TimeCycle

Code for [Learning Correspondence from the Cycle-consistency of Time (CVPR 2019, Oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07593). The code is developed based on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework. This repo includes the training code for learning semi-dense correspondence from unlabeled videos, and testing code for applying this correspondence on segmentation mask tracking in videos.

## Dataset Preparation

Please read [`DATASET.md`](DATASET.md) for downloading and preparing the VLOG dataset for training and DAVIS dataset for testing.

## Training
Replace the input list in train_video_cycle_simple.py in the home folder as:
```Shell
    params['filelist'] = 'YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/vlog_frames_12fps.txt'
```
Then run the following code:
```Shell
    python train_video_cycle_simple.py --checkpoint pytorch_checkpoints/release_model_simple
```

## Testing
Replace the input list in test_davis.py in the home folder as:
```Shell
    params['filelist'] = 'YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER/davis/DAVIS/vallist.txt'
```
Set up the dataset path YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER in run_test.sh . Then run the testing and evaluation code together:
```Shell
    sh run_test.sh
```
